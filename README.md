# Punchlist

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/punchlist.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/punchlist)

Counts the number of 'todo' comments in your code ('Comment
annotations').  Use in combination with the 'quality' gem in your CI
to keep the number of these 'punchlist' items under control.

To test quality:
  rake localtest

To run tests alone:
  rake spec

## Contributions

This project, as with all others, rests on the shoulders of a broad
ecosystem supported by many volunteers doing thankless work, along
with specific contributors.

In particular I'd like to call out:

* [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) for the
  cookiecutter tool and associated examples, which keep my many
  projects building with shared boilerplate with a minimum of fuss.
